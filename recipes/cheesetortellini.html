    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This tortellini recipie is full of flavor from crispy bacon to the creamy cheese it is sure to please your tastebuds.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
<li>2 (9 ounce) packages refreigerated cheese tortelini</li>
<li>6 strips bacon cut into small pieces</li>
<li>1 clove garlic minced</li>
<li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
<li>1 cup heavy/whipping cream</li>
<li>4 ounces cream cheese (1/2 block) softened</li>
<li>1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
<li>Boil a large, salted pot of water for the tortellini. Start cooking the tortellini once the bacon is done (it'll only take a few minutes for the tortellini to cook).</li>
<li>Cut the bacon into small pieces (I use kitchen shears to make the job easy). Fry it in a skillet over medium-high heat until crispy (about 10 minutes).
</li>
<li>Take the pan off the heat and remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate. Drain most of the bacon fat from the pan (keep about 1 tablespoon in there).
</li>
<li>Stir in the garlic, chicken broth, cream, and cream cheese. Return the pan to the burner (medium heat), and stir until you've got a smooth sauce and it's reduced to your liking (about 5 minutes).
</li>
<li>Stir in the parmesan cheese and bacon. Take the pan off the heat and toss with the drained tortellini. If the sauce is too thick, add a few spoonfuls of the pasta water. Season with salt & pepper as needed.
</li>
